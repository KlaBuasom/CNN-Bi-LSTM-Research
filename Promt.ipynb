    "For the Level-1 and Level-2 cA coefficients of Close, Open, High, and Low, which represent broader trends in the data, here's an architecture I'd recommend:\n",

    "Input Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Shape: (Lookback, Number of Features Ã— Number of Coefficients)\n",
    "CNN Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two 1D convolutional layers. The 1D convolution can effectively capture local patterns within the sequence.\n",
    "Filters: 32 for the first layer, 64 for the second.\n",
    "Kernel Size: 3 (this can capture patterns from 3 consecutive time steps).\n",
    "Activation: ReLU\n",
    "Batch Normalization: Helps stabilize the activations and improve training speed.\n",
    "Dropout: Around 0.2 to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "Bi-LSTM Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two bidirectional LSTM layers. This structure can capture longer-term dependencies and trends in the data.\n",
    "Units: 112 (as you mentioned earlier, aligning with the number of hidden units).\n",
    "Return sequences: True for the first Bi-LSTM layer to pass sequences to the next layer, and False for the second one.\n",
    "Dropout: Around 0.2 to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "Dense Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "One or two dense layers to capture non-linear patterns and relationships.\n",
    "Units: 56 for the first and 28 for the second (if a second one is used).\n",
    "Activation: ReLU\n",
    "Dropout: Around 0.2 to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "Output Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dense layer with units equal to the number of features you want to predict (in this case, 4 coefficients for the Close price of T+1).\n",
    "Activation: Linear (since we're dealing with a regression task).\n",
    "Batch Normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use it after CNN layers to normalize activations, improving the training process.\n",
    "Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement dropout in both the CNN and Bi-LSTM layers. A dropout rate of around 0.2 can be a good starting point. This helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of units during training.\n",
    "Optimizer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam or RMSprop are commonly used for such architectures. They adjust the learning rate during training, aiding faster convergence.\n",
    "Loss Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is suitable for regression tasks.\n",
    "This architecture combines the strengths of CNNs to capture local patterns and Bi-LSTMs to capture longer-term temporal dependencies. The dense layers further allow the model to learn non-linear patterns. Given the nature of the cA coefficients, which capture broader trends, this structure aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data. Regularization techniques, like dropout, ensure the model remains robust and doesn't overfit."
