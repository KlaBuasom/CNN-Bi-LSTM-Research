    "(Samuel): For the detail coefficients \\( cD \\) (Level 1) of Close, Open, High, and Low, as well as for Gain, and Loss, which are more reflective of short-term fluctuations and immediate changes, here's an architecture I think:\n",

    "1. **Input Layer**: \n",
    "   - Shape: (Lookback, Number of Features × Number of Coefficients)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bi-LSTM Layers**:\n",

    "     - Units: 112 (as you initially mentioned, aligning with the number of hidden units).\n",
    "     - Return sequences: True for the first Bi-LSTM layer to pass sequences to the next layer, and False for the second one.\n",
    "     - Dropout: Around 0.2 to 0.3, which can help in mitigating overfitting given the volatile nature of these features.\n",

    "   - Two dense layers to further process the sequences and capture non-linear patterns.\n",
    "     - Units: 56 for the first dense layer and 28 for the second.\n",
    "     - Activation: ReLU\n",
    "     - Dropout: Around 0.2 to 0.3. Given the complexity and the nature of the features, having dropout can help in preventing overfitting.\n",

    "     - Activation: Linear (since we're dealing with a regression task).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Regularization**:\n",
    "   - Implement dropout in the Bi-LSTM and dense layers. This will be crucial in preventing overfitting, especially given the volatile nature of detail coefficients and features like Volume, Gain, and Loss.\n",

    "(Samuel): For the Level-1 and Level-2 cA coefficients of Close, Open, High, and Low, which represent broader trends in the data, here's an architecture I'd recommend:\n",

    "1. **Input Layer**: \n",
    "   - Shape: (Lookback, Number of Features × Number of Coefficients)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CNN Layers**:\n",

    "   - Two bidirectional LSTM layers. This structure can capture longer-term dependencies and trends in the data.\n",
    "     - Units: 112 (as you mentioned earlier, aligning with the number of hidden units).\n",
    "     - Return sequences: True for the first Bi-LSTM layer to pass sequences to the next layer, and False for the second one.\n",

    "   - Use it after CNN layers to normalize activations, improving the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Regularization**:\n",
    "   - Implement dropout in both the CNN and Bi-LSTM layers. A dropout rate of around 0.2 can be a good starting point. This helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of units during training.\n",

    "\n",
    "This architecture combines the strengths of CNNs to capture local patterns and Bi-LSTMs to capture longer-term temporal dependencies. The dense layers further allow the model to learn non-linear patterns. Given the nature of the cA coefficients, which capture broader trends, this structure aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data. Regularization techniques, like dropout, ensure the model remains robust and doesn't overfit."
